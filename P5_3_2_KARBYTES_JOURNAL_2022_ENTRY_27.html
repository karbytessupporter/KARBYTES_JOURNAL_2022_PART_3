<p>23_AUGUST_2022: Some people have said that I have become noticably more pleasant over the past six months. That could be the result of Karlina getting equipment upgrades. For instance, Karlina finally upgraded from Teva sports sandals (a long time favorite) to New Balance gray running shoes (the best pair of shoes so far). Karlina also upgraded from a broken oversized &#8220;grand daddy&#8221; orange backpack (whose metal frame broke through the fabric and caused a lopsided weight distribution and consequential back strain) to an older smaller and cheaper green backpack (which is much less cumbersome and practically weightless compared to the more &#8220;purple&#8221; backpack). Finally, Karlina upgraded from a tattered sleeping bag with stuffing falling out and getting caught to twigs and leaves to a fresh clean sleeping bag of the same ilk.</p>
